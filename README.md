# Omeka S CLI
Omeka S CLI is a tool developed by [Libnamic](https://libnamic.com/?utm_source=omeka-s-cli-repo) that allows to manage Omeka S installs using a command line interface (CLI). The goal is to help maintain Omeka S and save time by automating daily operations such as module or theme installs and updates.
## About
This tool was created for [Libnamic Hosting](https://hosting.libnamic.com/?utm_source=omeka-s-cli-repo) and is included by default in all Omeka S installs as an extra feature for its customers. Given the benefits experienced with it, it was decided to publish it as open source under GNU AGPLv3 license, so anyone can benefit from it and contribute.
